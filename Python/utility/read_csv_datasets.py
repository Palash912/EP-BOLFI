    Example: cycling measurements from Basytec devices. Their format
    resembles a csv file with one title and one header comment line.
    So the first line will be ignored and the second used for headers.

    @par path
        The full or relative path to the measurement file.
    @par encoding
        The encoding of that file, e.g. "iso-8859-1".
    @par number_of_comment_lines
        The number of lines that have to be skipped over in order to
        arrive at the first dataset line.
    @par headers
        A dictionary. Its keys are the indices of the columns
        which are to be read in. The corresponding values are there to
        tell this function which kind of data is in which column. The
        following format has to be used: "<name> [<unit>]" where "name"
        is "U" (voltage), "I" (current) or "t" (time) and "unit" is
        "V", "A", "h", "m" or "s" with the optional prefixes "k", "m",
        "Âµ" or "n". This converts the data to prefix-less SI units.
        Additional columns may be read in with keys not in this format.
        The columns for segments and sign correction are only given by
        #segment_column and #correction_column.
    @par delimiter
        The delimiter string between datapoints. The default is "\t".
    @par decimal
        The string used for the decimal point. Default: ".".
    @par type
        Default is "", where only basic information is extracted from
        the file. "static" will trigger the additional extraction of
        exponential decays that are relevant to e.g. GITT.
    @par segment_column
        The index of the column that stores the index
        of the current segment. If it changes from one data point to the
        next, that is used as the dividing line between two segments.
        Default is -1, which returns the dataset in one segment.
    @par segments_to_process
        A list of indices which give the segments that shall be
        processed. Default is None, i.e., the whole file gets processed.
    @par current_sign_correction
        A dictionary. Its keys are the
        strings used in the file to indicate a state. The column from
        which this state is retrieved is given by #correction_column.
        The dictionaries' values are used to correct/normalize the
        current value in the file. For example, if discharge currents
        have the same positive sign as charge currents in the file, use
        -1 to correct that, or if the values are to be scaled by weight,
        use the scaling factor. The default is the empty dictionary.
    @par correction_column
        See #current_sign_correction. Default: -1.
    @par max_number_of_lines
        The maximum number of dataset lines that are to be read in.
        Default: -1 (no limit).
    @return
        A Cycling_Information or Static_Information object, depending on
        the value of "type".
